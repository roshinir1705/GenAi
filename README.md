# GenAi
This is a repository of the simple projects of generative Ai
Evloution of Genai:
AI-gen ai and non gen ai---non gen ai, no new data, just analysis of exisiting data and predicts.
statistical ML--->neural networks(deep learning)--for predicting images better,Recurrent neural networks,
language models-- multiple data feeded to predict the next line of the text.
transformer-special neural n/w structure
(text to text-bert, gpt 3, t5, text to video- Open Ai sora, text to image- Dall-E,Stable diffusion ), 
3 steps of tranformers -(Positional encoding, Attention, Self-Attention)
Vector DB- Locality Sensitive hashing--searching technique
langchain- framework built on top of LLM to build apps
